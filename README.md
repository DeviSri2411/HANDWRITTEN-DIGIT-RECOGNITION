# HANDWRITTEN-DIGIT-RECOGNITION
This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python with TensorFlow/Keras.
The goal of this project is to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, where each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image of a digit (0-9).
